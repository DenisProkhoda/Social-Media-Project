# Social-Media-Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Social Media Metrics Analysis GitHub repository! Our primary goal is to analyze historical metrics associated with social media projects, focusing on crucial metrics such as views, posts, plays, likes, and shares. This analysis aims to identify the top 5 countries with the highest engagement on these social media projects and calculate viewers and creators for each project within these top countries. Additionally, we will leverage Power BI to create dynamic visualizations based on the collected social media metrics data, top 5 countries, and viewer and creator data by countries.

## Artifacts
This repository includes essential artifacts for our analysis:
1.	Excel Files:

- Social Media Metrics.xlsx: This Excel file serves as a repository for your historical social media metrics data, encompassing views, posts, plays, likes, and shares.

- Top 5 Countries.xlsx: An Excel file containing a list of the top 5 countries with the highest engagement for the analyzed social media projects.

- Countries By Social Media Metrics.xlsx: An additional Excel file to store country-specific social media metrics data.

2.	Power BI File:

- Social Media Metrics.pbix: Utilize this Power BI file to create dynamic and interactive visualizations based on the collected social media metrics data, top 5 countries, and viewer and creator data by countries.

3.	Python Code:

- Calculate Viewers and Creators.py: This Python script handles the essential calculations to determine the counts of viewers and creators for each project within the top 5 countries, based on the social media metrics data.
